<p>On this website, I'll be showing off logos I create<p>
<p>Why?<p>
<p>Because I can.<p>
<p>I'll be making them for fun, whenever and however I want to<p>
<p>If you want one, just leave a comment on one of my videos and subscribe<p>
<p>And maybe I'll make one, only maybe, it ain't guaranteed<p>
<p>I am not saying that I will make one for sure if requested<p>
<p>I'm saying I will, if I want to :)<p>
